Finally, you’ve arrived. I’ve been waiting for you.

- Are you Meno?
	Yes, you’re right. I’m Meno—the one who left those notes for you. I always believed you could make it here. They took them beneath the lake. I’ve prepared notes to guide you on your way there.
	- Alright, thank you. I’ll head there right away.
		Bold words. But bravery alone won’t get you far here. The animals that were taken won’t be easy to reach. This place has traps, locked doors, and dangers you can’t predict. I hope you'll make it back.
	- Very well. Is there anything else you’d like to share before I go?
		You’ll need a weapon—they’re incredibly strong. There’s a prisoner named Lee who needs your help. Please assist him; in return, he’ll give you something that will aid you on your journey.
- I can guess, but who are you really, and why are you helping me?
	I am Meno, a hermit who has lived in the forest for decades. Why am I helping you? Because I see a strong resolve within you, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. Fight them, reclaim what you hold dear, and restore the balance that this place so desperately needs.
