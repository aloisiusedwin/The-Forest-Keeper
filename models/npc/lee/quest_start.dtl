I... need... help...
- Who are you?
	I was Lee... a worker in this cursed factory. I tried to escape, but the overseer... he took my hand as punishment. Now I am trapped here, unable to move on until my hand is returned to me.
	- Where is your hand now?
		My hand is still inside the factory, caught in the machine’s gears. Please... find it and return it to me.
	- Why is your hand so important?
		My hand is more than just a limb. It was a symbol of my defiance. Without it, I am incomplete. Please, find it for me. It’s somewhere in this factory, trapped in the gears of the machines.
- What happened to you?
	I tried to escape the factory’s grasp. The overseer punished me for my rebellion. They fed my hand to the machine, as a warning to others who might try to leave. Without it, I cannot rest.
	- How can I help you?
		My hand is still inside the factory, caught in the machine’s gears. Please... find it and return it to me.
	- What is this factory? Why did they do this to you?
		This factory was built to tear apart the forest—turning trees into tools of destruction. They said it was progress, but all it brought was misery. The overseer cared only for quotas. We were just cogs in the machine to him—easily replaced, easily discarded.
		When I tried to leave, to find a life beyond this place, he made an example of me. My hand... fed to the gears as a warning to the others. The factory consumed everything—our labor, our lives, even the forest itself.
		My hand is still inside the factory, caught in the machine’s gears. Please... find it and return it to me.
